given n : int
given number_of_clusters : int

given x : matrix [int(1..n)] of int
given y : matrix [int(1..n)] of int

find colour : matrix [int(1..n), int(1..n)] of int(0..number_of_clusters)

$ Edge colours must be symmetric and diagonal must be zero
such that
    forAll i, j : int(1..n) .
        colour[i,j] = colour[j,i] /\
        (i = j -> colour[i,j] = 0)
